When I went to Japan last year, one of the best meals I had (well, that's not fair because I had many) was chicken katsu curry.  I tried the curry in more upscale restaurants and I tried curries in hole-in-the-walls.  It was delicious each and every time.

I knew when I came back that I wanted to recreate this meal, so that I could have it whenever I wanted.
