### Directions

1. Chop chives, vegan shrimp and bamboo shoots into small pieces.  Add to a medium bowl.
2. Add the rest of the ingredients to the bowl and mix until combined.  Leave to marinate for 15 minutes.
3. After the filling marinates, roll dough out into long logs and cut into 32 portions.  Flatten the dough balls and using a rolling pin, roll to a flat disk about 4-inches in diameter.
4. Spoon in about 1 teaspoon of filling into the disk and then seal.
5. Line a steamer with perforated parchment paper and steam for 10-12 minutes until the skins turn translucent.  Let the dumplings cool for 3-4 minutes.
6. Add several tablespoons of oil to a pan on medium high.  Add in the dumplings and pan-fry both sides until the skin turns dark golden brown and is crispy, about 2 minutes each side.
7. Serve with soy sauce.
