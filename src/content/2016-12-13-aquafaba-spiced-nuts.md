When I worked at the bakery, one of the easiest and quickest holiday sellers was spiced nuts.  It takes virtually no time to make, yet fills the air with roasted, holiday goodness.  The nuts are super addictive, and I don't know anyone who wouldn't want to be munching on these during the holiday season.

So the neat thing about a spiced nut recipe is that it actually uses whipped egg whites to coat the nuts.  The egg whites help the spices adhere to the nuts and also gives them an amazing sheen.

I decided to use [aquafaba](http://eastmeetskitchen.com/videos/blog/what-is-aquafaba/) as the egg white substitute and it was able to produce the same results.  The only thing is you probably need to whip more aquafaba than necessary since the amount you need is so small.  Don't flood the nuts with the aquafaba.  Just use enough to lightly coat the nuts and discard the rest.  Otherwise, when the aquafaba combines with the sugar in the spice mixture, there is more of a tendency to burn in the oven.
