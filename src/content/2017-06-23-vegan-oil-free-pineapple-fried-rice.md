Pineapple fried rice is an amazing show piece.  The hardest part of the recipe involves hollowing out the pineapple.  My version is vegan and oil-free, which means the rice is flavor-packed with Thai flavors like lime juice and a hint of curry powder, but doesn't leave you feeling overly oily and full.

When it comes to the pineapple, make sure it is ripe enough to be cut.  True, some of the leaves may not look as pretty, but the pineapples will taste great and be easier to cut.  The easiest method I've seen is to just cut the pineapple down the middle.  Using a pairing knife, cut a 1/2-inch into the pineapple and then cut strips into the flesh.  Then you take a spoon and scoop out the meat.

A big part of fried rice is to make sure and have all the ingredients prepared because the actual cooking time should be very minimal.  My tip for the tofu, if it ends up sticking to your pan is to actually bake it at 350 degrees for around 20 minutes flipping in between.
