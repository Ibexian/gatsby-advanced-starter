I'm a "sides" girl when it comes to Thanksgiving, and one of my favorite sides happens to be cornbread.  I like it because it's not too sweet - well, it's hardly sweet and it can in fact, be somewhat savory.  Whenever I make stuffing, I always put a little cornbread in there to add some flavor and nitty gritty crunch from the cornmeal.  Yes, I'm not one for mixing too much flour into my cornmeal because I rather enjoy the texture.

This brings me to the addition of corn in my cornbread.  I realize that's not entirely southern, but is definitely delicious and is also an optional step.  I like the sweet bursts of corn you get when you bite into it.

There is a bit of sugar in this supposedly savory recipe, but it can be left out entirely as I use a bit of applesauce to subsitute for the egg, and that provides residual sweetness.
