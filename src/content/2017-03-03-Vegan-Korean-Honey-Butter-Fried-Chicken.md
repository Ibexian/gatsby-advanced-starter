I credit the original honey butter fried chicken to the great Maangchi.  I love watching her videos and all of her recipes are hella delicious.  Naturally, I thought for "international chicken day" - a day of collaboration between me and several other YouTubers that I could veganize this recipe and add a waffle in their to mix in a little southern flair.

Double-fried is key to the crispiness of any Korean fried chicken recipe.  This recipe is no different.  Usually you fry at a slightly lower temperature for the first round and then fry quickly at a higher temperature the second round.

### Directions

1. In a bowl, mix together the salt, black pepper, potato starch, flour and baking powder. Mix together the flax egg and add to bowl.
2. Add in the chicken substitute and mix until all the pieces are well-coated.
3. Meanwhile, heat up the oil in a small pot over medium-medium high heat.  Once the oil is hot, add in the chicken in batches and fry until lightly golden brown.  Take out chicken and place onto paper towel.  Continue until all batches are finished.
4. Turn the heat up to medium high and add the chicken pieces back in.  Fry for 1-2 minutes until golden brown.  Drain on paper towel and set aside.
5. In another pot over medium high heat, heat together the ingredients for the honey butter sauce. Cook for about 1 minute until thickened.  
6. In a large bowl, toss the chicken and sauce together until well-coated. 
7. Serve over prepared waffles. Garnish with scallions. Additional sauce or Earth Balance can be added.
