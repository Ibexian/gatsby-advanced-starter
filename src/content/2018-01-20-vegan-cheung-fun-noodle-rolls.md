Making your own rice noodle rolls can be a fun and unique experience, but it may be something you only do once and then settle for buying the noodles after.  It's not that the actual recipe is difficult, it's just that the process takes a fair amount of time and work.

Still, the argument for making fresh noodle rolls are that the fresh ones are always softer and you can definitely taste the difference.

Tip(s): 1) Wet the cutting board liberally before you put the rice sheet down. It prevents the rice sheet from sticking to the board.  2) Between each noodle roll, turn the steamer down to a low, rolling boil.  A lower heat will prevent the rice batter from immediately solidifying and give you time to move the batter around the pan to create a thin sheet. 3) Keep the rice noodle sheets fairly thin.  This will make rolling it up easier and also for the ingredients you put in to show through, not to mention a thinner sheet gives a better mouthfeel.

1. In a large bowl, mix together the rice flour, potato starch, wheat starch, salt and water until smooth.  Cover and set aside for 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile have a pot of water on a light, rolling boil and put in a steamer tray.  
3. Soak a cotton or polyester towel in water.  Wrap the towel around the sheetpan.  Place the sheetpan in the steamer.
4. Pour in a thin layer of batter into the towel-wrapped sheetpan.
5. Turn the steamer up to medium-high.  Cover the steamer and steam for about 4-5 minutes, until the batter solidifies.
6. Meanwhile, wet a cutting board liberally with water.
7. Carefully lift the towel from the sheetpan and place the towel rice side down onto the wet cutting board.
8. Using a bench scraper, scrape the rice layer from the towel and slowly peel the rice layer from the towel.
9. If adding carrots or scallions, sprinkle a small amount onto the top portion of the rice noodle roll.
10. Using your hands or the bench scraper, fold the rice layer back into a long roll. Cut noodle roll in half.
11. Brush with vegetable oil or water and top with additional scallions and sweetened soy sauce.
