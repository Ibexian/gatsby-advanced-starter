By now, you guys know I'm addicted to coconut desserts.  Coconut is fragrant, creamy and rich.  My rule of thumb when I make coconut desserts is to not have it be overly sugary because I like the flavor of coconut.  I think sugar is that ingredient that can really bring out the coconut's flavors, but if you use too much, the dessert just ends up tasting like sugar.

This dessert is the perfect mix of something that is light and not overly sugary, but with a lot of coconut flavor.  It is Chinese coconut jelly and is usually served in the dessert dim sum carts.

It's really nothing more than coconut gelatin, only it's prepared with agar, which Asians often use more than gelatin.  Because the original version uses milk and coconut cream, there is often no separation between the fats.  Because I have substituted nut milk in this recipe, which does not affect the flavor at all, you will often find that there is separation between the water content and the fat content of the coconut cream as the agar solidifies.
