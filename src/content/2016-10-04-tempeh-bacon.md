I love putting tempeh bacon onto sandwiches.  It can be a simple BLT or dress up something like an egg and cheese sandwich.  The one thing I hate about tempeh bacon is the price.  Whereas I can usually find a package of tempeh for $2- $3 at the grocery store, tempeh bacon runs upwards from about $4.50 to almost $5.50 a package.

Like many items at a grocery store, you can usually save a lot of money if you make it yourself.  True, sometimes getting it prepared is a time-saver, but this recipe is so easy that making your own tempeh bacon is definitely very worth it.   You can make it in big batches and tempeh bacon stores very well and can be frozen.
