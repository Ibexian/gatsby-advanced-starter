I don't want to say I have a favorite or best dim sum recipe that I veganized, but if I were to choose one, this is hands down it.  The texture of fried tofu skins mimics the skin on the chicken claws so so well.  The fried tofu drinks up the sweet and savory and spicy flavors of the chicken claw marinade.  The recipe is amazing and a definite must try.
