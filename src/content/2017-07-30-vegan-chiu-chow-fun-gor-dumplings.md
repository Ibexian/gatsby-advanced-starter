Chiu Chow fun gor is one of my favorite dim sum dumplings.  The wrapper is made from a mix of wheat, tapioca and cornstarch, which is what gives the wrappers its clear appearance and soft chewy texture.  The filling for these dumplings is also unique because it's not tightly-packed like regular dumplings.  Inside is a loose mix of ground up meat, crunchy vegetables like carrots and water chestnuts and also coarsely chopped peanuts and cilantro.

As usual I opted to use Gardein's beef crumbles as my choice of a ground meat substitute.  I like it for its neutral flavor, but you could very well use some rehydrated TVP as a vegan option.

Because of the starch composition in the dough, it is quite fragile and somewhat difficult to work with if you are looking to shape the dumplings.  Instead, just opt for folding the dumplings in half into a half moon shape and pinch the edges.

### Directions

1. Combine all the ingredients for the wrapper dough.  Knead until a dough ball forms and no longer sticks to the hands.  Add more wheat starch if needed.  Cover and set aside.
2. Combine all parts of the "meat filling."  Set aside and let marinade for 30 minutes.
3. In a pan with 2 tablespoons of oil over medium high heat, add in the diced carrots.  Cook for 2 minutes.  Add in the water chestnuts, mushrooms and prawns.  Stirfry for 1 minute.  Add inthe salt, chicken powder, white pepper and sesame oil.
4. Meanwhile, mix together the cornstarch, water and vegan oyster sauce.  Add it to the vegetable mixture.  Cook for another 1-2 minutes.  Put filling into a bowl to cool.
5. Add the chopped radish and cilantro to the cooled vegetable mixture.
6. On an oiled surface, divide the dough into 16 pieces.  Roll into 4-inch circles and fill with 1 tablespoon of filling.  Fold dough in half to form a semi-circle.  Pinch edges to seal.
7. Place dumplings onto a parchment lined steamer.  Steam on medium high heat for 8-10 minutes, or until the wrappers become clear.
8. Brush dumplings with a light layer of vegetable oil.  Serve while hot.
