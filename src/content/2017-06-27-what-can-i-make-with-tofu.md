If you're uninspired from boxed tofu like I am, here are a couple ideas to help you out!

__1. Pan-Fried Tofu__

I love pan-frying tofu as opposed to deep frying.  You get a lighter and less oily product that is still crunchy.  [In this recipe](http://www.pbs.org/food/fresh-tastes/pan-fried-tofu/), I pan-fry it with a bit of sesame oil, so the flavor is jam-packed.  Then a sweetened soy sauce is drizzled over the top, offering the perfect balance of sweet and salty.

__2. Baked Tofu__

Baked tofu is easy and the clean up is a cinch.  I personally like to marinate it with some soy sauce and honey.  I bake the tofu cubes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit making sure to flip them halfway in between.

__3. Stuffed Tofu__

So this recipe is a Chinese Hakka recipe my mom used to prepare.  She would take soft or silken tofu, hollow out the center and fill it with fish paste.  It was absolutely delicious and recipes can be seen [like this one](http://thewoksoflife.com/2013/10/stuffed-tofu-hakka-style/) from Woks of Life. For a vegetarian version, mashed beans with seasoning would easily do the job!

__4. Kimchi Tofu Soup__

I'm a big fan of Korean soups.  I think they are warm, hearty and filling and could easily substitute a meal.  Here is a [kimchi tofu soup recipe](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/sundubu-jjigae) from Maangchi, one of my favorite Korean YouTubers.  She uses meat in her recipe, but a vegetarian broth can easily be substituted or made with water and some Korean bean paste.

__5. Tofu Scramble__

[Tofu scrambles](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-scramble-tofu-234849) are way easy to make and they go well with vegetables, tempeh bacon and various other breakfast delights.  You simply crumble up extra-firm tofu with a fork, add a little tumeric for color and salt and nutritional yeast for flavor.

__6. Tofu Poke__

This is the easiest [recipe](http://eastmeetskitchen.com/videos/recipes/tofu-poke-bowl/) of the list.  Marinated tofu poke is rich with "Hawaiian" flavors that you would normally marinate fish with, only it's just as good on tofu!  The best flavor happens overnight, but what I love about the recipe is that you don't have to cook it.  Just throw it over some salad and you have yourself an amazing meal.

__7. Tofu Chocolate Mousse__

I usually don't make too many desserts with tofu because the soy flavor is so prevalent, but because the flavor of chocolate is so strong, it usually masks that.  Here I have an easy [recipe](https://aseasyasapplepie.com/silken-tofu-chocolate-mousse/) from As Easy as Pie that I'm sure will have all of your mouths watering.
