I was actually planning on a vegan pumpkin pie this year, but at the last minute, was drawn to the allure of pumpkin bread instead.  Then I went one step further and said, "what the heck?", I would bring back aquafaba and turn this whole thing into a cake.

Aquafaba if you don't know about [aquafaba](http://eastmeetskitchen.com/videos/blog/what-is-aquafaba/), it's basically the leftover liquid you have after cooking beans.  It has similar properties to egg whites and can be whipped like it as well.  I have a [post](http://eastmeetskitchen.com/videos/blog/what-is-aquafaba/) and basic vanilla aquafaba cake [recipe](http://eastmeetskitchen.com/videos/recipes/aquafaba-vanilla-sponge-cake/) on it that explains a lot about this vegan phenom.

Anyways, this recipe really works because the aquafaba is able to lighten what is more of a heavy pumpkin bread.  I chose to use pureed dates for sweetness in this recipe, but if you are looking for a lighter texture, just substitute for brown sugar or a sugar substitute.

It's great for holidays and parties because the flavors just scream autumn and Thanksgiving and Christmas.  If you put it in a decorative bundt pan you can decorate the center and turn it into an amazing centerpiece as well.
