I'm always impressed at the thought of making a curry or any meal rather with just shelf-stable pantry items.  Sure, I enjoy my trips to the grocery store and bringing home loads of fresh produce, but sometimes, I just want to make something delicious with what I have.

I don't think anyone would think you can do that with curry.  Sure, some of these items are more specialized, but once you've made a trip to the Asian grocery store, these ingredients can stay in the pantry for as long as time allows.  And of course, with frozen vegetables, I don't have to worry about them going bad.  Not to mention, most are picked at the peak of ripeness and then flash frozen to seal in the nutrients, so we're good!

This is a "throw everything into one pot"- type of recipe.  It takes me about 15 minutes to make and the longest part of the process is waiting for the rice to cook.
