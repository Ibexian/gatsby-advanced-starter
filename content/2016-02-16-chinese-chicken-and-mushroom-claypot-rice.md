Claypot rice is a one-pot, Chinese favorite.  The idea is that as the rice is almost cooked, you add on the toppings and everything finishes cooking at the same time.  The sauces from the toppings combine with the rice for a flavorful one-pot dish.

### Directions

1. Start cooking rice according to packaged instructions.
2. Cut chicken thighs into 1-inch cubes.  Put into a bowl along with the salt, cornstarch, oyster sauce, soy sauce, garlic, rice wine and ginger.  Mix until chicken is evenly coated.
3. Cut shitake mushrooms into halves or quarters and put into a bowl.  Set aside.
4. In a pan over medium high heat, add 2 teaspoons of oil.  Add in the chicken and cook until chicken is about 80 percent done.  Add in 3-4 tablespoons of water to build the sauce.
5. When the rice is about 80 percent done, pour the chicken mixture over the rice.  
6. Cook for another 5-6 minutes or until the chicken is cooked and the sauce has been absorbed into the rice.
