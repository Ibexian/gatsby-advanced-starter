### Directions

1. In a pot, mix custard powder, sugar and non-dairy milk until there are no lumps.  Heat over medium heat until thickened.  Mix in green tea powder and coconut oil.  Set aside to cool.
2. Put custard mixture into a piping bag and pipe nickle-sized balls onto parchment paper.  Put into freezer for 3-4 hours or until frozen.
3. Prepare dough by mixing glutinous rice flour and water with hands.
4. Pull out 1-inch pieces of the dough.  Flatten with fingers and put frozen custard filling into the center.  Seal the dumpling and roll in between hands until a ball forms.  Place onto a sheetpan with parchment paper.
5. Dumplings can now be cooked immediately or frozen for later.  If cooking immediately, add dumplings to boiling water and boil for 1-2 minutes or until dumplings are floating.  If cooking frozen dumplings, time will be about 5 minutes.
6. To prepare the syrup, bring to a boil the water, sugar and sliced ginger.  Turn off heat.
7. Add dumplings to the syrup and serve.
