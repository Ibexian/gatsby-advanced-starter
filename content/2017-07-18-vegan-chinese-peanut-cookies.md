These Chinese peanut (not peanut butter) cookies are a really fun treat during Chinese New Years.  It's made from ground up roasted peanuts, so the texture is sandy and more like a peanut shortbread cookie rather than a peanut butter cookie.  It's going to be an amazing treat for anyone who likes peanuts in their dessert.
