### Directions

1. For the wrapper, mix together the wheat starch, sugar and boiling water until combined.  Add in the glutinous rice flour and cut in the shortening.  Add in the room temperature water a little at a time until the dough comes together.  Cover and set aside.
2. In a bowl, combine the vegan beef crumbles, rice wine, garlic powder, white pepper and sesame oil.  Set aside and let marinade for 15 minutes.
3. In a pan on medium to medium high heat, add in 1 tablespoon of oil, the carrots, shiitake mushrooms, vegan shrimp, water chesnuts, five spice powder and sugar.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the carrots soften.
4. Meanwhile in a small bowl, combine the cornstarch, water and vegan oyster sauce.
5. Turn the heat down of the pan down to medium and add in the cornstarch mixture.  Cook until thicken, about 1 minute.  Add in the vegan beef crumbles.  Turn off heat, add in the scallions and set mixture aside to cool.
6. Once filling is cooled, divide the dough into 12 equal pieces.
7. Using your hands, flatten the dough to 4-inch diameter disks.  Add in 1 tablespoon of filling and close up the dumpling by folding it in half and pinching the edges to seal.  Repeat for the rest of the filling.
8. Heat a pot of oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and drop the dumplings in 3 to 4 at a time without overcrowding the pot.  Using a wire strainer, move the dumplings around so that they do not sink to the bottom.
9. Fry until golden brown, about 5-6 minutes.  Drain on a paper towel.
