1. In a bowl, mix together all of the ingredients and knead until a smooth ball forms, about 3-4 minutes.  Wrap in plastic wrap and rest in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight.
2. On a lightly-floured surface, roll the dough to an 8-inch by 6-inch rectange.  Cut rectangle into four 2-inch by 6-inch strips.
3. Stack 2 strips on top of one another and using a chopstick, press down on the centers of the strip lengthwise.  Flip over and press down again.  The 2 strips should now be joined.  Repeat with the other 2 strips.  Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.
4. Heat a pot of oil to 350 degrees.  Take one of the rested strips and stretch the dough to almost double its length as you drop it into the oil.
5. Fry for about 2 minutes each side or until golden brown.  Drain on a paper towel.
6. Fried cruellers can be frozen for up to 6 months.
