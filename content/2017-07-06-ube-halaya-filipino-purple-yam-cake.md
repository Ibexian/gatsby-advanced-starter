Ube Halaya or Halayang Ube is a Filipino dessert made with purple yams along with coconut milk and condensed milk.  These purple yams are uber vibrant and make for an amazingly looking purple cake.  The yam mixture is also used as filling for pastries and even put on things like toast.

The most difficult part of this recipe is having to stand over the stove and stir the mixture for about 30 minutes until it reduces down.  But the result is an amazingly creamy, coconut-infused mixture that is delicious on anything.

A very important note to remember if you wish to unmold this cake is first, you need to freeze it.  The cake has a very soft set and if you want a neater presentation, freezing is a must.  Also, it is best to use a spring-form pan.  or to line your pan with parchment and transparent wrapping tape, otherwise the cake is not coming out.
