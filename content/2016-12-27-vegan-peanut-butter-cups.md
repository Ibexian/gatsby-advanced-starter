I love the all-natural peanut butter cups you find in stores, but they can get quite pricey - usually averaging $1 per peanut butter cup.  I found that it was actually quite easy making them at home and you can create some pretty good "store-quality" results.  

The best thing about making them at home though is you can control what goes in, and I decided to add dates to the peanut butter as the main sweetener.  You can't really tell they are there, but occasionally, you'll get these bursts of sweetness from pieces of dates that may not have gotten all blended.

__Tips:__ This recipe is fairly simple, but there are some key tips to keep in mind while you put the peanut butter cups together.  First, in order to create that "Reese's Peanut Butter Cup" look with the fluted edges, you want to be making the chocolates in cupcake liners.

The next tip is to make the peanut butter filling disks nearly the same or as close as possible to the diameter of your cupcake moulds. This keeps you from having to use too much chocolate and for the sides of the peanut butter cups to have too thick a chocolate edge, which I never like.
