This is a really easy way to make a dim sum favorite - BBQ Pork Noodle Rolls.  I took long rice noodle rolls, unwrapped them into a sheet and then filled them with my jackfruit "pork" filling.  Using this method, you can fill the noodle rolls with anything you want.

Probably the most difficult part of this recipe is to unroll the rice sheets.  In a dim sum restaurant, the noodle sheets would be made fresh with a thin rice batter and steamed so that it firms up.  We are going to steam the noodle rolls to soften them just a bit.  Don't do it longer than 5 minutes because if they get too soft, they will be difficult to handle.

The trick is to unwrap the noodles in a bowl of water.  Because the noodles already have some oil painted in between, it should unravel easily, albeit you should do it slowly to avoid tears.  It will also be very helpful to paint a bit of water on the board where you are rolling the noodle roll to keep it from sticking.  Don't overfill the noodles and using a bench scraper is definitely a must to help roll the noodles back up.

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. 
2. Pull the jackfruit and place onto a baking sheet.  Bake for about 10 minutes to dry out.
3. Put cooled jackfruit into a bowl.  Add in the char siu sauce, curry powder and garlic powder.  Mix until jackfruit is coated.  Put aside.
4. Steam noodle rolls for 4-5 minutes until softened.  Remove and put into a bowl of cold water. Un-roll the noodles until it becomes a flat sheet.
5. Put some water on the cutting board.  Gently place the rice noodle sheet onto the cutting board.  Sprinkle several leaves of cilantro onto the rice noodle sheet.  Spoon a thin strip of jackfruit onto one end of the noodle sheet.
6. Using a bench scraper, roll the noodle sheets starting from the jackfruit side until a roll forms.  Cut in half and gently place onto the plate.  
7. Reheat the noodle rolls slightly by placing it back into the steamer for 3-4 minutes.
8. For the sweet soy sauce, mix the soy sauce, sugar and water in a bowl.  Pour over noodle rolls when serving.
