### Directions

1. In a bowl with a spatula, gently mix the the TVP, chickpea flour, white pepper, garlic powder,vegan prawns, bamboo shoots and spring onions together.  Add in the ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice wine and 1/4 cup water and mix until combined.  Finally add in the vegetable oil.  Cover the mixture and let sit for 10 minutes.
2. In a small bowl, mix together 1/4 cup water with the cornstarch.
3. Divide the filling into 5 portions and place one portion onto the bottom of the tofu sheet.  Using your fingers, spread the mixture into a 4-inch wide log.
4. Roll the tofu sheet over once, fold in both sides, then finish rolling until 1/2-inch from the end.  Using your fingers, dab a little bit of the cornstarch mixture onto the edge.  Finish rolling and place the tofu skin roll seam side down onto a sheetpan or plate.  Repeat with the rest of the rolls.
5. Heat 3-4 tablespoons of oil in a pan over medium to medium-high heat.  Place the rolls seam side down onto the pan and fry until side is dark, golden brown, about 2-3 minutes each side.  Remove from pan and drain on paper towel.
6. Meanwhile, in a bowl, mix together the ingredients for the sauce.  Pour the sauce into a pot on medium-high heat.  Bring mixture to a boil, while constantly whisking.  Once the sauce has thickened, about 2-3 minutes, take it off the heat.
7. Place tofu skin rolls on a clean plate.  Pour half to three quarters of the sauce over the rolls.  
8. Steam in a pre-heated steamer until the filling cooks through and the tofu skins are moist, about 12-15 minutes.
9. Garnish with scallions and additional sauce. Eat immediately.
