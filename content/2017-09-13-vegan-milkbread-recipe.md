This is a super universal, all-around recipe if you like Chinese bakery products.  For so many who have turned vegan, the choice to do so meant they had to give up Chinese bakery items.  Well not anymore.  With this recipe, you can make delicious [vegan pineapple buns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fL8owA3wH8&t=7s) or fluffy and coconut-rich, [vegan cocktail buns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY173Qk_7aQ&t=15s).

1. Prepare the roux by mixing the flour and water in a pot and cooking it over medium heat for 3-4 minutes until mixture is thickened. Set aside.
In a mixing bowl, combine the yeast, 1/4 cup of the coconut milk and sugar. Cover and let sit for 5 minutes.
2. In a small bowl, prepare the substitute egg by mixing together the water, baking powder and oil.
3. In a separate bowl, combine the flour and salt.
4. In a mixing bowl with the dough hook attachment, mix together the yeast mixture, egg substitute, roux and the rest of the coconut milk until all is combined.
5. Add in the flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined. Increase speed to medium and knead for 10 minutes.
6. Slowly add in the Earth Balance butter until it combines with the dough. Increase speed again and continue kneading for another 10 minutes until dough is elastic. Cover dough and let rest for about an hour until it has doubled in size.
7. Cut dough into equal portions. Form into balls and place into pan. Cover the dough and let rest for another hour.  In a separate bowl, mix the contents of the glaze.  Brush over the dough.
8. Bake dough at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 30-35 minutes.
Brush top with Earth Balance.
