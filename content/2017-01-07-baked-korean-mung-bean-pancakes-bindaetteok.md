Korean mung bean pancakes are heartier versions of the kimchi or scallion pancakes you see at the restaurants.  It is made of pureed beans and rice, which give it a more substantial and slightly crunchier feel.  The taste is still filled with savory korean flavors and blanched vegetables like ferns and beansprouts are added for additional crunch.

Probably the most unique thing about these pancakes (other than the fact that they are baked) is that it is made from the whole mung bean and the whole rice kernel.  Traditional recipes are made with split mung beans without the green skin and also glutinous white rice, which doesn't carry any of the fibers and nutrients of the bran.  Surprisingly, adding the beans and rice in whole form didn't affect the taste of the pancakes, so choosing the one with more nutrients and fiber is a no-brainer.
