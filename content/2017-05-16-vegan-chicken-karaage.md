Chicken karaage is Japanese double-fried chicken.  And when I say double-fried, it means these little fritters are hella-crunchy and also, hella-addictive.  Usually the double-fried method involves the initial fry at a lower temperature, but for a slightly longer time.  The second fry is at a slightly higher temperature for a lesser time.

I used my favorite brand of faux chicken and let me tell you, I don't think you'll really notice a difference.  The backdrop of the ginger and garlic marinate flavors the chicken and the crunchy exterior does the rest.

### Directions

1. In a bowl, mix all the ingredients in the seasoning section together and fold in the faux chicken pieces.  Let marinate for 15-30 minutes.
2. In another bowl, mix the potato starch, flour and a pinch of salt and pepper together.  Transfer chicken mixture into the flour mixture.  Stir until chicken is fully coated with flour mixture.
3. In a pot of oil at about 320 degrees Fahrenheit, put in a few pieces of chicken at a time and fry until a light golden brown, or about 60 to 90 seconds.  Strain and put on paper towel.  Start on the next batch until all the chicken is done.
4. Turn heat up until about 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  Put chicken back into the fryer a few pieces at a time until golden brown.  Drain onto paper towel.
5. Serve with a wedge of lemon.
