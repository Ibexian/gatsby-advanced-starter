I saw this gift idea in one of the baking magazines and absolutely loved it.  I decided to do it for vegan cake mix because there have been so many times when I've wanted to make a vegan cake, but was too lazy to look up a recipe and may or may not be sad that I don't have all the ingredients.

This mix is the perfect gift because all you need to add are household ingredients that everyone should have - water, vinegar and oil.  This is a very basic recipe, so if you want to spruce it up, maybe add some spices or nuts, be my guest.  I think for anyone who is vegan and likes cake, this would be the perfect gift.  And it's super easy to make!
