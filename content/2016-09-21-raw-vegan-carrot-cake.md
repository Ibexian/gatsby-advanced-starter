Carrot cake is one of my favorite cakes, and I don't care how heavy it is, it's going to be my wedding cake when I get married.  I have a feeling though that a lot of it has to do with that cream cheese frosting and after deciding to go mostly vegan (like 95% of the time except for when I travel and special occasions, et cetera et cetera), it's been hard to abandon this slice of my life.

I'm also looking for healthier desserts these days, and I don't want one leaving me overly stuffed and guilty because it has way more sugar than it needs.  So when I watched [Jenny Mustard's vegan inspo video](http://jennymustard.com/vegan-inspo-an-unrefined-vegan-raw-carrot-cream-cheese-squares/) on raw vegan carrot cake via [An Unrefined Vegan](http://anunrefinedvegan.com/2014/02/06/raw-carrot-cake-cream-cheese-hearts-sugar-and-gluten-free/), I couldn't wait to try the recipe.  (My secret hopes of being a minimalist - Jenny's blog focuses on simple living - is a whole other issue. It may never happen.  I've got way too many plates I just can't throw away, but a girl can try.)

Anyways, this is a dessert I'm proud to eat.  It's filled with nuts, fruits and veggies.  I love the cashew cream cheese filling.  It really makes the cake for me.  The best thing is I can package and freeze some.  When I want a treat in the middle of the day or after dinner, I can just grab one.

### Directions

1. Using a food processor, puree all the ingredients of the cashew cream together until smooth, making sure to scrape down the sides.
2. Spread mixture evenly in a quarter sheet pan lined with parchment.  Refrigerate for 2-4 hours until set.
3. For the carrot cake layers, blend all the ingredients until desired smoothness.  Additional water may be necessary.  
4. Spread mixture onto a lined half sheet pan.  Using a knife, split mixture in half by cutting down the center.
