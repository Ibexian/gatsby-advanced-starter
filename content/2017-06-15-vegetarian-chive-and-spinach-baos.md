### Directions

1. Mix together the warm water and yeast.  Let sit in a warm place for 5 minutes.  Then add in the flour.  Knead until a smooth ball of dough forms.  Cover and set aside for 1 hour or until dough doubles in size.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the ingredients of the filling.  Set aside.
3. Put risen dough onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into 24 equal pieces and roll into small balls.
4. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into disks about 4 inches in diameter, concentrating on having the edges be thinner than the middle.
5. Fill the disk with about 1 tablespoon of filling.  Go around the edges and fold dough like an accordian around the entire disk.  Repeat with rest of the dough.
6. Place the baos on a parchment-lined steamer, cover and let rest for 30 minutes to an hour.
7. Place the risen baos in a pre-heated steamer on medium high heat and steam for 12-15 minutes.
8. Serve immediately or freeze.
