Crab rangoons are definitely a classic, "holiday, Chinese takeout item." I wanted to do a vegan version that was just as savory and delicious, but without having to use the fryer.  This will ensure the house smell of the holidays instead of grease.

I used jackfruit to replace the imitation crab meat in crab rangoons.  For those, who are not familiar, jackfruit is a, lightly-sweetened fruit native to Southeast Asia, and its flesh likens itself very much to meat.  It pulls apart very similarly to pulled pork and for me, if the product is dehyrated just a tad more, it gets even more meat-y and less like fruit.

I used the teriyaki-flavored jackfruit product from the [Jackfruit Company](http://www.thejackfruitcompany.com/).  I thought since we were dealing with Asian flavors, it wouldn't be a bad idea that the jackfruit was pre-marinated.  The results were amazingly savory and a little sweet as well.  Because the crab rangoons were baked, the jackfruit dehydrated a bit more and got even more meaty.  I would say it's different
