Mochi ice cream is a favorite dessert in Asian restaurants, but a lot of the times, there aren't vegan options.  So this is my solution to DIY mochi ice cream.  I mix flavorings into my favorite vegan vanilla ice cream and then wrap that around with a layer of sweetened mochi dough.

The recipe is quite fun to make, but you cannot tamper too long when wrapping the ice cream or else it will melt and make a sloppy mess.

### Directions

1. Scoop six 3 tablespoon-sized balls of ice cream and freeze.  If mixing with various flavors, mix the ice cream, re-freeze, and then scoop and freeze for about 4 hours until the ice cream is hard.
2. To prepare the mochi layer, mix the glutinous rice flour, water, sugar and potato starch until there are no lumps.
3. Cook in a 1,000 watt microvave for 1 minute. Stir the mixture.  Cook for one minute again, stirring after.  Then finally cook for another 30 seconds.  
4. Put mochi dough onto a sheet tray dusted with a layer of potato starch.  Dust the top fo the mochi with potato starch as well.
5. Roll out into an 8x12 inch rectangle.  Place into the refrigerator to cool for 15 minutes.
6. Cut six 4x4 inch squares and place between sheets of plastic wrap.
7. Working one at a time, place frozen ice cream ball into the center of the mochi sheet.  Fold in the four corners and using the plastic wrap, quickly twist and form a ball with the mochi.  Immediately place in the freezer.
8. Freeze mochi for 4 hours or until the ice cream is hard.
