This is one of my go-to soups in the winter time.  It is super quick and easy to make and it leaves me feeling warm and satiated.  The key is to find a good vegan chorizo you like.  I bought mine from Trader Joe's.  It's a bit spicy, but flavors the soup quite well.

I make sure and brown the onion and potatoes first to develop flavor for the soup.  Towards the end, remember to adjust for flavor.  I add lemon juice to a lot of my dishes not really because I need it to be more sour, but lemon juice really helps to brighten up all the flavors and make them taste fresher.
