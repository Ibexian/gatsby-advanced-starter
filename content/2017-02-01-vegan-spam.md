If you haven't seen my review on vegan spam, check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?).  This vegan spam recipe is probably the one most commonly referred to on the internet.  It's a combination of soybean flour, peanut butter, tomato juice and several other flavorings.  I'll say it's definitely not a perfect substitute for Spam's soft and gelatinous texture, but the flavor is not bad.  Because of the myriad of Asian recipes which call for Spam, it's not a bad idea to have the recipe under you sleeves.

### Directions

1. Combine the soy flour, nutritional yeast, cornmeal, sea salt and garlic powder into a bowl.
2. In a food processor, puree the celery, onions, water, tomato juice and soy sauce for about 3 minutes.
3. Add the wet mixture to the dry and combine with a spatula.
4. Put mixture into 2 cans.  Seal the top with tin foil and a rubber band.
5. Place the cans into a pot of water 1/3 the height of the cans.  Bring to a boil and lower heat to a rolling boil.  Cook for 2 hours.  Cans will expand.
6. Let cool.  Open the bottoms of the cans to release the vegan spam.
