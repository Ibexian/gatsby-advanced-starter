### Directions

1. Boil fried tofu sheets in salted water for 5 minutes.  Drain and repeat the process.  Leave tofu sheets in the refrigerator for several hours to dry out.
2. Cut the fried tofu sheets into strips.  
3. In a pan over low to medium heat, fry the ginger and garlic until aromatic, about 2 minutes.
4. Turn eat up to medium high.  Add in the tofu strips, white pepper, salt, sugar, rice wine and soy sauce and stir-fry for about 30 seconds.  Finally, add in the scallions.
