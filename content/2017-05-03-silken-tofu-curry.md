When I became vegan, I sort of became an "extra-firm" tofu snob. All of the hip salad bars and hummus bowl spots were using extra-firm tofu, so I abandoned my silken tofu, which was the only type of tofu I knew growing up in search for firmer pastures.

But your past has a way of catching up with you and several weekends ago, when I was over at my Uncle Georges for lunch, he made this amazing, comforting and warming silken tofu curry.  I was so relieved to not bite into chunks of rough soy, which of course is trying to mimic the texture of meat.  The texture of the silken tofu was soft as pudding and glided gently through your taste buds.  When you ate the tofu curry with rice, it was almost like the tofu melted into the curry to create this amazing, silky ragout.

Anyhoot, the recipe took all but 15 minutes to make.  The curry is thickened with a slurry, and it doesn't get any more simple and down-home than this.  I went ahead and substituted peas for edamame beans simply because I like the texture and taste of edamame to peas.

A note for those who don't like spice is to take it easy on the curry powder.  There's a whole concoction of spices in there, so perhaps add half the amount and adjust to taste as you go.

### Directions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan over medium-high heat.  Add in the carrots and edamame.  Turn heat down to a medium and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the carrots start to brown.
2. Add in the curry powder, garlic powder, ginger powder, onion powder and salt.  Toast the spices for about a minute, until fragrant.
3. Add in the vegetable stock or water.  Cover and bring mixture to a boil.  Then turn heat down and simmer for 6-7 minutes, or until carrots are tender.
4. After carrots are tender, prepare a slurry by mixing the cornstarch with 1-2 tablespoons of water.  Add the slurry into the curry and turn up heat until curry thickens.
