"Har gao" shrimp dumplings are probably the king of Chinese dim sum.  These are the dumplings that you must order when at dim sum.  I'm not exactly sure why this is the case, but it may have something to do with the large whole shrimp that are usually put into the dumplings, which are clearly evident because of the unique clear wrapper, which the dumpling employs.

I use a faux vegan shrimp, which bears an uncanny similarity to the real deal, in my dumplings.  Good shrimp dumplings are a mix of ground shrimp for a softer, easy-to-bite mouth feel and whole shrimp.

Probably one of the most important portions of this recipe is the wrapper.  It can't be too moist and it can't be too dry.  The texture that you're looking for is for the wrappers to be malleable and stable enough where when you make the folds on the dumplings that the folds hold.  However, if you end up mixing too much starch into the mix, the dumpling dough will surely hold, but it will crack and then you have a mess on your hands.

My tip is to first, always have extra wheat and potato starch in case the dough is indeed too wet and you need to stiffen it up.  The second tip is to simply rip off a piece of your finished dough, roll it out, and see if you can fold it and that fold stays up and doesn't crack.  It's obviously harder to fix a dry piece of dough than it is to add a bit more starch to the wetter one.

### Directions

1. Mix all the ingredients for the dough in a mixing bowl, reserving a little bit of the wheat starch and cornstarch.  Knead for 2-3 minutes until dough no longer sticks to hands.  Add in additional starch if needed.  Let sit for 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile mix all the ingredients for the filling together.  Set aside for 15 minutes.
3. Divide dough into 16 pieces and roll them out into 4-inch diameter disks.  
4. Fill each wrapper with about 1 tablespoon of the filling.  Fold one side of the wrapper like an accordian and seal it to the back by pressing firmly.
5. Place on a steamer lined with parchment.  Steam on medium high to high heat for about 10 minutes until the wrapper becomes clear.
