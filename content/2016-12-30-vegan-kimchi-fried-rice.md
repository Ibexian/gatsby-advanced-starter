Fried rice is a classic dish around the world.  It's usually a mix of leftover food and in different parts of the world, those can be different things. I love the idea of using kimchi because not only does in provide crunch and a ton of flavor, but the red from the chilis in its juice colors the rice beautifully.  It's a great vegan dish because you're not short of flavor and any additions you add be it mushrooms, tofu or more veggies will only contribut more flavor texture to the dish.

I recently went to this annual kimjang kimchi festival event in southern Massachusetts.  Basically during the kimchi festival, families in Korea come together and make a ton of kimchi for the year.  It is an event that UNESCO has recognized as a world heritage
