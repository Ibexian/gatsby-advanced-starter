### Directions

1. For the sauce, mix everything into a bowl until smooth.  Add more water to get desired consistency.
2. Dip the rice paper wrap in warm water for about 20 seconds, until the wrap is pliable, but not overly soft.
3. Add in vegetables, being sure not to overfill.
4. From the bottom, roll up until halfway, fold in the sides and finish rolling.
